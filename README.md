According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_enumeration#Software),
network scanner is a computer program used to retrieve usernames and info on groups, shares, and services of networked computers.
This project is based on ideas of scanner [NESCA](https://github.com/pantyusha/nesca) - it is simple scanner for everyone. PySca includes GUI-interface. The project is not just another fork of nesca - it is analogue built from scratch using Python language.
